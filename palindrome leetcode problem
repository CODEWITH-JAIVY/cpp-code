we dive into solving the popular LeetCode problem of checking if a string or number is a palindrome using C++. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. We'll start by understanding the basic concept of palindromes, followed by a step-by-step approach to solving the problem in C++. I'll explain the logic clearly with examples and then move on to writing the C++ code.

Topics Covered:
What is a palindrome?
Approach to checking if a string or number is a palindrome.
Time complexity analysis.
Edge cases like an empty string or single character input.
Practical coding demonstration in C++.
